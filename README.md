# Earth-Messenger
An ocasional game written in python for a coursework. Includes digit span test.

Welcome to my game folder. If this simple game brings you a good time, even it was a while, then it will have completed its duty. Have a nice experience! =D

Any suggestion or bug can be sent to lifeng.qiulin@student.manchester.ac.uk (although the author dont' think that this game is ever going to be public)



# STRUCTURE


* Game program: EarthMessenger.py
* Images file: images (shouldn't be modified)
* Data file: data (to reset the data, double click reset_data.py, the location shouldn't be modified neither)
* Explanation text: README.txt

# SOME NOTES


* In order to open the game file, python and standard library should be installed.
* The game is designed in a resolution 1366x768, and in fullscreen mode.
* The author is an HCI student who was seeking a mixture in terms of CS and PSY, thus this game. In this game, a simple Digit Span Task is tested when playing, implemented by a simple code to make it more playable. The purpose is to combine these two disciplines.
* The game's core process is speedy as this task tests players Short Term Memory (STM) that without further rehearsal or consolidation, will disappear around 20~30 seconds, hence each round in the game is rather fast.
* As the previous point pointed out, the author had implemented save and load features in how levels progress.
* The code is almost in accordance with PEP8, excepting for E501, which stands for too long lines. But this shouldn't be a problem nowadays, with advanced text editors with automatical wrap option.

## Now once you have played...

* Sorry for using messagebox to pause...
* The cheat code, although it doesn't make a lot of sense in this kind of memory game, is introducing "life" when asked for the code, then you will pass the level regardless the real code. To be honest, the most powerful cheat code here is to write down directly the numbers, or just change the source code of the game XD...
* The boss key is <Tab> key, once pressed, the main window will quit from fullscreen mode, and another window will pop up.
* There is a known bug, sometimes, there are two rounds of airdrops. The reason is unknown currently, but it doesn't affect the code that should be introduced, just follow the first one.
* This is not a bug, but a choice; if you introduce the right code at first place, then whatever you add after, it is correct.
